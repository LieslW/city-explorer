# Project Name

**Author**: Liesl White  
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)  

## Overview  

City Explorer is an interactive application which allows the user to access multiple APIs to explore various cities, the weather there, and famous movies that took place there. It's a helpful and also fun way to help users possible plan for vacation or explore their local cities.  

## Getting Started  

1. Set up your React repository with the basic skeleton structure, connecting it to both github and deployment  

## Architecture  

To start, I built the City Explorer application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages.  
To build the foundation for this application, I used React, an open-source front-end JavaScript library, on Visual Studio Code. This was connected to my personal github to save and track all versions.  
For deployment, I used Netlify.  
For API calls, I utilized the axios library to faciliate easy access to my various APIs.  
For my data, I used various APIs, such as:  

- LocationIQ: cities, exact lat and long, and map view  

Finally, for my styling, other than CSS I also used the React Bootstrap, a component based library.  

## Change Log
